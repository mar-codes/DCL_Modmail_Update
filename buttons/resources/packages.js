üì¶ - Slash Command Package
The legacy package for older videos, perfect for beginners but not built for scale. This is the go-to if you are new to development here on discord!

üì¶ - Dev Toolkit
All new and improved with some much needed fresh paint, this package is built to last and comes with everything a starting developer could need, how awesome is that?

üèÖ - Badge Images
This is just an archive of images for the older [Badge Command](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ay4ZUFSQIWs), this is not a package for running bots!`,
